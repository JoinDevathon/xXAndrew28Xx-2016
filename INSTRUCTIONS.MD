Wow, hi judges! Anyways to start you can go in creative and get yourself a **crafting bench** and inside it surround **a furnace** with **8 redstone**. Now place it down on the floor and put a **chest** on top! Now put **coal** in to the chest. It won't generate power yet because it doesn't have a buffer. Once you place down a **power bank** though, it will start making energy. Make a **power bank** by crafting **8 emeralds** around **a redstone block** and place it right next to the **steam generator**. The **steam generator** will now pump energy in to the **power bank**. If you put **two or more powerbanks** it will split the power evenly. If you restart everything will still work because all of this is **saved directly** in to the world file in **machines.dat** (isn't actually a data file, its YML. Just a .dat so people won't mess with it). So you can send the world to other friends, and if they don't have the plugin; it will not do anything to prevent the word from loading.
